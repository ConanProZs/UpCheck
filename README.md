# Welcome
If you don't know what UpCheck is then I am going to explain it in [What is it, And what are the requirements?](#what-is-it-and-what-are-the-requirements).


## How to use
First, you need python installed on your server computer and it needs Linux or windows to run.
Second, you need a web server on your server computer, If you don't have one you can use the server.py file.


## What is it, And what are the requirements?
It's a program for people that have a server computer with Linux or Windows 10.
*You can run it on Mac but it's not tested on it.*

It allows you to moderate your server computer with another computer

##### Here are the requirements for the server computer:
- Latest version of python *(recommended)*
- A web server *(You can use our server.py file if you don't have a web server)*
- [Ngrok *(It is free!)*](https://ngrok.com/)

##### Here are the requirements for the computer with the UrlChecker:
- Latest version of python *(recommended)*
- UrlChecker.py file on it
